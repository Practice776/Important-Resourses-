Introduction
Hello there. I am Shanmukha Sainath, working as AI Engineer at KLA Corporation. I have done my Bachelors from Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering department, IIT Kharagpur.

Why I made this?
Internet world is huge, so as resources to learn any new things. There are numerous free and paid resources to learn Machine Learning. Having many options in hand confuses and it's difficult to select best one (saying from experience). So, I have collected best resources to get started with Machine Learning and continue career in this field.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome :)

Frameworks/Libraries
"No tutorial/course is better than Documentation :)"
But I am sharing other resources for some libraries to learn them quickly. Whenever you got stuck at some function or implementation. It is always better to refer documentation/tutorials/code present in official website.
